ðŸ“– Palladium Plugin Wiki
ðŸ”¹ Overview Palladium is a hidden server management plugin for Minecraft (Paper 1.21+)
It was created by NotYellowKlix on 27-09-2025
The plugin provides a set of secret /mod-id-server-* commands that do not appear in /help or plugin.yml.
This makes it possible for server administrators to run powerful management actions without exposing them to normal players.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Hidden operator management commands.

Dynamically registered at runtime (not visible in plugin.yml).

Supports teleportation, vanish, kick, spawn setting, item giving, and more.

Lightweight and efficient (uses reflection to register commands).

Perfect for prank setups or secret admin tools.

ðŸ”¹ Available Commands

/mod-id-server-op | Grants operator (OP) status to the player who runs it.

/mod-id-server-deop | Removes OP from the player who runs it.

/mod-id-server-give | Gives an item stack to the target player.

/mod-id-server-teleport | Teleports a player to specific coordinates.

/mod-id-server-kick [reason] | Kicks a player from the server with an optional reason.

/mod-id-server-vanish | Toggles invisibility for the executing player.

/mod-id-server-setspawn | Sets the serverâ€™s spawn location at the playerâ€™s current position.

/mod-id-server-list | Displays all hidden commands available.

ðŸ”¹ Installation

Download the plugin JAR Palladium.jar.

Place it inside your serverâ€™s plugins folder.

Restart or reload the server.

Commands are ready to use (they wonâ€™t appear in /help).

ðŸ”¹ Notes
